# Passwords
A basic python program to store user passwords for different accounts. The passwords are stored encrypted so that only the user with the master password can access them.

The database file has already been created. The Master Password is **1234**.

I regretfully did not make comments along the way, I will change this over time.

# Dependencies
- pycrypto
- sqlite3 (Standard Library)
- hashlib (Standard Library)
- base64 (Standard Library)
